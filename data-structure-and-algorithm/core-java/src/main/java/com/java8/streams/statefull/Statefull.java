Stateful operations, such as distinct and sorted, may incorporate state from previously seen elements when processing new elements.

Some examples are:

Stream<T> distinct(). Returns a stream consisting of the distinct elements.
Stream<T> limit(long maxSize). Returns a stream truncated to be no longer than maxSize in length.
Stream<T> skip(long n). Returns a stream with the remaining elements of this stream after discarding the first n elements.
Stream<T> sorted(). Returns a stream sorted according to the natural order of its elements.
Stream<T> sorted(Comparator<? super T> comparator). Returns a stream with the sorted according to the provided Comparator.
